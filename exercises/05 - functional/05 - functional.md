## Functional programming exercise

1. Write a function that returns `true` if an input integer is prime.
   Try with list comprehensions and lambdas. Check the `is_prime`
   implementation in the first exercise for some hints.

2. Try to find all the prime numbers between 2 and 10000.
   Time the results. (*Hint*: `import time` and `time.time()`)

3. Now try to rewrite this so that memoization helps.
   Time the results.

4. Create a decorator that measures the time for invoking a function
   and prints it. Refactor your code and use it to measure the time.
